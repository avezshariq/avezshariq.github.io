# My Stories (Blog Home)

Welcome! This is where code meets craft. While many developers stop at the "*how*", I'm obsessed with the "**why**" — and I've found that the best way to explain complex systems is to... well... show them

I've always found that a good diagram can do more than a wall of text. Because I work with vector graphics, I aim to explain complex concepts using *illustrations* to make the details easier to follow. Whether you're here to solve a specific problem or just to see how things work under the hood, I hope these visual breakdowns help
