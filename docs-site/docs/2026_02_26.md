# Copying in Python (WIP)

## Motivation 💪🏻
Lets say, we are creating a list of ingredients for 🍋lemon tea and 🫚ginger tea. Trust me, the ☕tea  and this example are both effective. Since both of them have common ingredients we proceed in this way:

- Create a list named `tea` with all common ingredients
- Copy the list to a new name called `lemon_tea`
- Add *lemon* to the *lemon_tea* list
- Copy *tea* to a new name called `ginger_tea`
- Add *ginger* to the *ginger_tea* list

I have given the exact sequence of steps because, in the process of creating *tea*, we would end up in a spaghetti🍜

Lets do it in code 👉🏻

```python
tea = ["Milk", "Sugar", "Tea Powder"]

# Lemon Tea
lemon_tea = tea
lemon_tea.append("Lemon")

# Ginger Tea
ginger_tea = tea
ginger_tea.append("Ginger")

# Print results
print(tea)
print(lemon_tea)
print(ginger_tea)
```
```python
# Output to show from the code
return 0
['Milk', 'Sugar', 'Tea Powder', 'Lemon', 'Ginger']
['Milk', 'Sugar', 'Tea Powder', 'Lemon', 'Ginger']
['Milk', 'Sugar', 'Tea Powder', 'Lemon', 'Ginger']
```
Notice how insertions happened in all the lists. Now, that's a big mixup. Lets take a closer look why it happened
