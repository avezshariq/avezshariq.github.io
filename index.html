        <h1>Projects Showcase</h1>
        <p>My work is a direct reflection of my commitment to being a polymath in my field. While my main focus might be in my silly cubicle in corporate world, but my weekends are usually reserved for diving into a variety of projects that challenge me in new ways. This is where I push boundaries, experiment with Art-Code fusion, and build things just for the joy of it. This diversification not only keeps my skills sharp, but also fuels my creativity. You can take a look at a few of my projects below or view all projects directly</p>

                <p>This case study developed a churn prediction model for 7,000+ telecom customers. Following data cleaning and EDA, the model was refined through multiple iterations of feature selection using RFE and VIF to eliminate multicollinearity. After reaching satisfactory training results, the model was validated on test data to predict churn probability effectively</p>

        <h1>Noteable Skills</h1>
        <p>With a strong foundation in Python, I build solutions by integrating diverse libraries. I love exploring and combining packages—like those for data analysis, web frameworks, and machine learning, to tackle new challenges. This approach lets me create flexible, custom tools that go beyond standard applications. For more insight on this, you can look into my projects</p>
